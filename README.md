# Lethal Company Manual Discord Logger

![GitHub License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-GPL--3.0-blue)

## Description

Lethal Update Relay is a fun application designed to provide a novel way to log your Lethal Company games to Discord. It utilizes the Python tkinter library for its user interface. Not the best code, but I was having fun!

## Installation

To use this application, simply download the latest EXE file from the [Releases](https://github.com/Huckleboard/LethalUpdateRelay/releases) section. Always make sure to download the highest version number available.

## Usage

1. Run the downloaded EXE file.
2. When prompted, input your Discord webhook URL. If you do not, an orange flashing message will be present.
3. Fill out a minimum of three fields to transmit a message to your Discord server.
If you need to change your Webhook URL, go to your Documents file, and then to "UpdateRelayData", and the webhook_url.txt file.

NOTE: Because this program is packaged as a pyinstaller program & is unknown to most anti-viruses, you may get a false positive report. (I am not buying the microsoft dev key/hashes/whatever)

If you wish to build the program yourself, start by looking in the rawScript folder above.

## Features

- Easy-to-use interface for logging game updates.
- Easy Webhook integration with Discord.
